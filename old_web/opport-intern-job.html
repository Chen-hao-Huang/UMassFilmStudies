    <p>My name is Ally Sullivan and I am the MassLIFT AmeriCorps Community Engagement Coordinator for Kestrel Land Trust in Amherst. Through my AmeriCorps program I am encouraged to build the capacity of outside organizations within my community by collaborating with Kestrel on conservation minded projects. I know that Kestrel has been hoping to collaborate and increase connections with the five colleges in the area and figure out ways to work together. One of the major projects that I am hoping to complete during my term of service is a farmer landowner interview documentary. I am hoping to create a compelling vision of the importance of local food and preserving farmland in the valley. I was hoping that perhaps there is an opportunity to collaborate with the film studies program at Umass but also at the other colleges in the area on a project like such. I have no film skills or background and therefore would definitely need assistance from a technical point. Any insights or ideas on a possible collaboration are greatly appreciated! Thank you!<br />

    <p>Smith College graduate Emma Weinstein is in the valley for the fall to shoot a new web series and is looking to build a production team.  Slots are open for Location Scouts, PAs, Costume and Set Assistants, Publicity Assistants, Associate Producers, Assistant Directors of Photography and a Sound Editor.

      </p>
    <p>THE STAND-INS
      <br />
      The Stand-Ins tells the story of a young experimental theatre company, who find themselves arrested (not to mention bankrupt) after performing their controversial new play on tour.  In order to make bail and survive as 20-something artists, they stay in the small town and hire themselves out as "Stand-Ins" impersonating people in real life situations for hire. The show chronicles these misadventures as the company navigates the fine line between art and reality, humor and disaster, determination and downright idiocy.  
      </p>
    <p>DATES
      <br />
      The Stand-Ins will shoot in Northampton and around Pioneer Valley between November 1st and 20th. Exact dates are still being determined by the creative team. We would need any new team members to begin meeting for prep as soon as possible.

      have many opportunities to demonstrate and develop initiative and leadership skills   
      through independent and team projects.  Interns will complete regular progress reports. </p>
    <p>Interns are usually contracted for one 3-credit Internship (working eight hours per week)   
      for the duration of the spring  semester.  In addition, interns are expected to staff all   
      events of the Massachusetts Multicultural Film Festival.  Most events will

      place at the Five Colleges.  Interns are expected to assist with preparation and clean-up   
      before and after each event, and will serve as greeters and perform other activities

      activities including filmmaker and scholar dinners/receptions.      </p>
    <p>In any of these capacities, students have the opportunity to gain valuable experience in   
      assisting the Interdepartmental Program in Film Studies in festival curating and public   
      relations, while earning supervised academic credit for their activities.   The    
      Massachusetts Multicultural Film Festival as a whole represents a valuable educational   
      opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students who will be able to interact directly   
      with a diverse cross-section of film artists and scholars from around the world.      </p>
    <p> Interns must be enrolled in the Undergraduate Film Studies Certificate program. In the fall semester, please submit a letter of interest along with a current resume to:      </p>

    <h3> Pioneer Valley Jewish Film Festival  Internship<br />
</h3>
<p><img src="images/PVJFF_wShadow_wYellow.jpg" alt="PFJFF" width="210" height="200" border="0" align="right" class="image_inside" />The <a href="http://www.pvjff.org/" target="_blank">Pioneer Valley Jewish Film Festival</a> is celebrated each spring. The intern is part of a  small team that collaborates with numerous partner organizations to  mount an annual 2-week spring festival in 3  counties in the Pioneer Valley of Western Massachusetts. The Festival  brings hard-to-find Jewish-related films to a diverse audience including  those with an interest in Jewish culture, history, politics and  identity, and anyone seeking entertainment, education, and insight  beyond mainstream cinema offerings.</p>
<p>Working in a non-profit foundation, the intern  uses skills in project management, public relations, and marketing. <em>Being  creative and pro-active in targeting new audiences (reaching out to  organizations and individuals who can connect their constituents with  our festival) is central to the work of the intern</em>.</p>
<p>This  internship provides the chance to learn about Jewish  identity, the local &amp; global Jewish community, interfaith and  intercultural issues, as well as to learn first-hand the art and  business of running a film festival. Interns have the opportunity to  screen (at home) internationally acclaimed films not often found in  mainstream theatres.</p>
<h4>Requirements</h4>
<p>Interest in Jewish culture;  excellent organizational, internet, writing &amp; computer skills; strong interest in developing marketing skills; ability and  desire to think creatively and take initiative, as well as to work as  part of a team; a good sense of humor; and flexibility. College junior  or senior preferred. Time Commitment: 5 hours/week. Ideal candidate  would be available January through April, but intersession or spring  semester placements are considered, as well. Location: West Springfield, MA. Some work can be done remotely.</p>
<h4>How to Apply </h4>
<p>Send resume, cover letter and names of 2 references to:<a href="mailto:janet@hgf.org"> janet@hgf.org</a>.    </p>

<h3> The     Media Education Foundation Internships</h3>
    <p>Intern and volunteer positions with the  <a href="http://www.mediaed.org/jobs" target="_blank">Media Education Foundation</a> are structured around the college  semester system. Positions are available for Spring, Summer, and Fall in  both Production and Marketing/Administration. Internships and volunteer  positions are unpaid, but we do offer credit for currently enrolled  students. <br />
  </p>
<h4>Qualifications </h4>
    <p>Interns should understand and be comfortable with the nature of MEF's work providing hard-hitting, progressive media criticism and scholarship in an accessible format and language through video. They should also be comfortable working in an atmosphere where media images representing extreme violence and sexual imagery are sometimes part of the picture. Interns should also be computer savvy in basic programs and Internet savvy, since more and more research requires on-line searching. Previous video production experience or course work is not absolutely required, but it can be useful in getting the most out of the internship. </p>
    <p>For work in the marketing aspects, some experience or course work in that area, and Internet savvy is useful. A successful intern is a self-starter who takes the internship as seriously as they would any new job and tackles each assignment with initiative, imagination, energy, and determination.    </p>
    <h4>How to Apply </h4>
    <p>Other than taking care of the University or college's requirements for securing credit for the internship, applicants should send the following: <br />
