    <p>The CMI is a four-week, intensive, summer program that will run from June 8 to July 3 in 2015. The CMI alternates between Screening Seminars and Creative Labs.  What makes the CMI different from other programs is its singular, cross-medium approach to the craft and critique of still and moving images. Bringing still and moving image artists together under one roof to comment, critique, learn from, and appreciate one another was a founding principal of the original summer institutes that took place in the 1970s. </p>
    <p>The Screening Seminars fall on the 1st and 3rd weeks of the CMI. Participants take part in daily screenings bookended by discussions and interviews led by artists, scholars, and critics. Guest artists bring in colleagues to screen and discuss works. The goal of the Seminars is to bring together a community of diverse perspectives for week-long, intensive looks into specific areas of cinema, video, and photography. The Seminars are designed to be stand-alone programs. Anyone, (undergrads, artists, educators, curators, and programmers) can attend one or both Screening Seminars.</p>
    <p>The Creative Labs fall on the 2nd and 4th weeks of the CMI.  During the Creative Labs, students follow separate paths based on the medium (moving or still image) and mode of expression (nonfiction or fiction). Students attend workshops in the morning and head out into the field during the afternoon. The Labs provide a safe space to experiment with approach, style, and practice.  Only participants attending all four weeks of the program can take part in Creative Labs.    </p>

          <div>
            <p>Hollywood talent as diverse as <strong>Martin Scorsese</strong>, <strong>Lisa Cholodenko</strong>, <strong>George Lucas </strong>and <strong>Joss Whedon </strong>got their start at a film school, all of which are named and ranked here on <a href="http://www.thr.com" target="_blank"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>'s inaugural list (comprised with help from industry insiders) of the world's best.</p>
            <p><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/thrs-top-25-film-schools-354506" target="_blank"><strong>PHOTOS: THR's List of the Top 25 Film Schools Of 2012 (Updated)</strong></a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>1. American Film Institute</strong></h3>
            <p>Among the most selective film schools in America, AFI's Center for  Advanced Film and Television Studies in Los Angeles offers a two-year  conservatory program where students specialize in fields including  directing, producing and writing, often coming to the institute after  working in the industry or having attended other schools. Its &quot;fellows&quot;  are typically more mature (average age is 27) and benefit from speakers  and teachers drawn from the highest levels of the industry, supported by  the full weight of AFI itself. Comparing it to cross-town rivals UCLA  and USC is a bit of apples-and-oranges, given its small size and  emphasis on specialization, but AFI's glittering parade of alumni, from  David Lynch to Darren Aronofsky, remains unrivaled when it comes to  auteur filmmakers. Students are guaranteed the freedom to make a thesis  film and are given access to SAG members for their casts and $13,500 in  financing. If you know where you're going, AFI can get you there.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $38,416 for first year; $37,112 for second year (plus $8,033 for thesis)</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> MFA, certificate of completion</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Terrence Malick (<em>The Tree of Life</em>), David Lynch (<em>Blue Velvet</em>), Darren Aronofsky (<em>Black Swan</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;I love AFI and would be nowhere without it.&quot; -- <strong>David Lynch</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>2. University of Southern California</strong></h3>
<p>The richest film school in the world (alum George Lucas contributed  $175 million, and alum Robert Zemeckis has given a bundle, too), USC  probably has more graduates working in the industry than any other  school and has the greatest support from the industry itself, with  10,000-plus alums who routinely donate millions for state-of-the-art  facilities -- and notable support from non-graduate Steven Spielberg.  Its Peter Stark Producing Program, under <em>The Graduate</em> producer  Larry Turman, remains the premier venue for aspiring producers and  execs. Insiders were split when asked to choose between AFI and USC for  the No. 1 spot, with AFI winning largely on the basis of its choice  student body. But USC takes the candle when it comes to technical  training. Says Dean Elizabeth M. Daley: &quot;One of the hardest things to  understand is the culture of filmmaking. You're not gonna get that out  of a book. Come here and you'll understand.&quot; She's right, thanks to  unrivaled facilities, an emphasis on film history and technique and its  great ties with Hollywood -- a plus for some, but not for those more  interested in indie films. The upside: It's a vast dream factory. The  downside: It's a vast dream factory.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $42,000 (plus room and board)</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> Critical studies, B.A., M.A., MFA and Ph.D. programs in everything from film and TV to animation and digital arts</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> George Lucas (<em>Star Wars</em>), Ron Howard (<em>A Beautiful Mind</em>), Jon Landau (<em>Avatar</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;USC is run in many ways like a studio. The challenges that were  given to us had to do with the realities of the industry and financing,  and I think those were important lessons to learn.&quot;   -- <strong>Lee Unkrich</strong>, director, <em>Toy Story 3</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>3. Beijing Film Academy</strong></h3>
<p>If one film school anywhere in the world has shaped a whole nation,  it's the Beijing Film Academy, China's most elite school for film  direction, production and writing. Each year, it accepts about 500  applicants -- primarily from China -- out of 100,000. The school is  a  source of new talent for film and TV production and closely linked with  the nearby Beijing Film Studio. It's also the place where such directors  as Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige -- the ones who created arguably the most  distinct new wave of filmmaking since America in the early 1970s -- cut  their teeth. (At 27, Zhang had to get special permission to attend  after the Cultural Revolution because he had passed the cut-off age.)</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> Program fees range from $1,240 to $1,550 for  local students; international students pay $6,665 to $7,905 per year  for film programs. Partial and full scholarships are available based on  need and merit and are awarded on an individual basis.</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. programs in everything  from performance and direction to cinematography and animation. All  degree programs are conducted in Chinese, though international students  may take some courses in English or study Chinese at the Film Academy.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Zhang Yimou (<em>House of Flying Daggers</em>), Chen Kaige (<em>Farewell My Concubine</em>), Tian Zhuangzhuang (<em>The Blue Kite</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>4. New York University Tisch School of the Arts</strong></h3>
<p>To study film in New York is to plunge into the belly of a very  different beast than Hollywood, but for gritty artists like Martin  Scorsese, Oliver Stone and Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan, NYU has  proved a direct route to the top. Where else can you sit in a class of  12 and hear alum James Franco teach you how to turn a poem into a movie?  Graduates also vie for a $200,000 prize to complete a debut feature  film -- a gift no other school offers. In addition to its New York  campus, Tisch School of the Arts Asia, located in Singapore, offers MFA  degrees in animation and digital arts, dramatic writing and film  production. Summer programs include professional workshops and noncredit  certificate courses.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $45,674</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.A., BFA, MFA, MPS, M.A. and Ph.D. degrees  in moving-image archiving and preservation as well as performance  studies or cinema studies</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Todd Phillips (<em>The Hangover</em>), Joel Coen (<em>No Country for Old Men</em>), Charlie Kaufman (<em>Being John Malkovich</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;Getting accepted to Tisch meant one thing to me: hope. It validated  all of my dreams and made the concept of becoming a filmmaker a tangible  possibility. Teachers like Tom Drysdale and Haig Manoogian inspired me,  infusing me with a lifelong passion for cinema history. I carry their  artistic philosophy with me on every film: Never compromise, never stop  asking questions and never stop being a student of film.&quot; -- <strong>Chris Columbus</strong>, writer-director, <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>5. University of California Los Angeles</strong></h3>
<p>UCLA's School of Theater, Film and Television has long suffered in  comparison with its richer and more industry-connected rival USC, but  its vibe is distinctly different, with a multicultural campus that ranks  among the best in California. It has benefited from such prestigious  graduates as Francis Ford Coppola and Alexander Payne; from teachers  like producer Peter Guber; and from its connection with the respected  UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive, whose collection is &quot;second only to  the Library of Congress,&quot; according to Dean Teri Schwartz. The  well-regarded Schwartz will likely determine UCLA's future standing:  After serving for years at Loyola Marymount, the former producer (and  Goldie Hawn's onetime producing partner) joined the university in 2009,  replacing veteran Robert Rosen. Now insiders are waiting to see how  things will change under her leadership. Look for her to stress  &quot;humanistic storytelling and global diversity&quot; -- quite different from  the commercial emphasis of many other film schools.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> B.A.: $12,842 (California resident), $35,720  (non-resident); MFA: $22,208 (California resident), $34,453  (non-resident); M.A. or Ph.D.: $13,549 (California resident), $28,651  (non-resident) </p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.A., M.A., MFA and Ph.D.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Francis Ford Coppola (<em>The Godfather</em>), Tim Robbins (<em>Dead Man Walking</em>), Alexander Payne (<em>Sideways</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;The key is having a point of view -- which is very much the UCLA  approach. You could say UCLA filmmakers try to bring an indie attitude  even to studio pictures. We always try to find some kind of  subjectivity.&quot; --  <strong>Justin Lin</strong>, director, <em>Fast Five</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>6. California Institute of the Arts</strong></h3>
<p>CalArts is way beyond what founder Walt Disney could imagine. &quot;It is a  paradox, an experimental art school,&quot; says CalArts School of Film/Video  Dean Steve Anker. &quot;You usually have music, theater, dance  conservatories and art schools, but you don't have them under the same  roof.&quot; Anker's film/video school is most famous for training animation  talents, but besides character-based and experimental animation, you can  study dramatic narrative, documentary, experimental live action,  multimedia and installation. CalArts-spawned geniuses like John Lasseter  and Tim Burton can do more than draw -- they can draw on the artistic  talents around them. Says Anker: &quot;CalArts in general, and certainly the  school of film and video, is this very large laboratory for the creative  arts.&quot; &quot;Large&quot; is right: The classrooms occupy 11 acres' worth of  square footage 30 miles north of Los Angeles.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $37,684</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> BFA, MFA in film, video and experimental animation; MFA in film directing; BFA in character animation</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Tim Burton (<em>Alice in Wonderland</em>), Andrew Stanton (<em>Finding Nemo</em>), John Lasseter (chief creative officer, <em>Pixar</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;I have so many great memories of CalArts. Sitting in the dark,  hunched over the old Oxberry camera, shooting my film. The giant  papier-mache butt from someone's art installation in the main gallery.  Playing Lazer Tag in the empty halls in the middle of the night. But  what I remember most are all the great friends that I made, many of whom  I work alongside today.&quot;  -- <strong>Don Hall</strong>, co-director, <em>Winnie the Pooh</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>7. The Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague</strong></h3>
<p>Located in the &quot;city of 1,000 spires and 29 McDonald's,&quot; as  expatriates like to say, FAMU is the fifth-oldest film school in the  world and one of the most prestigious. Created in 1946 when Prague was  behind the Iron Curtain, it helped develop such iconoclastic filmmakers  as Milos Forman, Ivan Passer, Agnieszka Holland, Emir Kusturica and Jiri  Menzel and served as a hub for student rebels during Czechoslovakia's  Velvet Revolution. With classes in Czech and English, its reputation is  still strong enough that it draws many foreigners to its nine  departments (ranging from still photography to documentaries to  screenwriting), something helped by partnerships with NYU's Tisch School  of the Arts, American University and Yale, all of which offer  study-abroad programs there.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $45,674</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> MFA in cinema and digital media</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Milos  Forman (<em>Amadeus</em>), Emir Kusturica (<em>Black Cat</em>, <em>White Cat</em>), Agnieszka Holland (<em>The Killing</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;I believe deeply that in any film school, you can learn as much, or  even more, from the fellow students as from the teachers. But in FAMU in  the late 1960s and early '70s, when I was studying, some of the  teachers were great. My main instructor Karel Kachyna was indeed one of  the most skilled directors of his generation. Jan Matejovsky in the  television directing department taught us how to be diplomatic with  actors, crew and producers. I still use his very useful advice.&quot; -- <strong>Agnieszka Holland</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>8. Columbia University School of the Arts</strong></h3>
<p>You know when James Schamus is one of your professors, things can't  be too bad. Schamus, the head of Focus Features (who recently completed a  doctorate on Carl Theodor Dreyer), is just one of the feathers in this  Ivy League university's cap. Another is Oscar winner Milos Forman, the  school's longtime leader. Then there's a staff that includes Barbara De  Fina (<em>Goodfellas</em>) and Mira Nair (<em>Monsoon Wedding</em>).  Names like these give Columbia intellectual credentials that dwarf its  peers and have helped attract such alumni as Kathryn Bigelow, Lisa  Cholodenko, James Mangold and Kimberly Peirce -- not necessarily  Hollywood's most commercial filmmakers, but always among its most  original. Will it remain that way under its new chair, Fine Line  Features founder and indie exec Ira Deutchman? Deutchman insists on  story and collaboration -- two Hollywood ideals -- yet stresses the  importance of the artist. &quot;You have to keep an eye on the business, but  it's first and foremost about creating artists,&quot; he says.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> MFA first and second years: $50,873 per year; M.A.: $44,264</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> MFA in film; M.A. in film studies</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Kathryn Bigelow (<em>The Hurt Locker</em>), Lisa Cholodenko (<em>The Kids Are All Right</em>), Nicole Holofcener (<em>Walking and Talking</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;My years in the film program taught me the craft of screenwriting as  well as the business of making movies. In so many ways, Columbia was  the perfect combination of arts: conservatory and trade school, a place  where I could read Aristotle and Eisenstein on narrative theory and  analyze budgets and box office like a science. The lessons learned at  Columbia -- how to analyze and synthesize perspectives, how to treat  your work as an ever-evolving document -- serve me every day.&quot; -- <strong>Simon Kinberg</strong>, screenwriter, <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>9. Wesleyan University</strong></h3>
<p>OK, so everyone knows about the Hollywood infiltration of places like  USC and UCLA. But they might be surprised to learn that Wesleyan's Film  Studies program is giving those two a run for their money, with a  tight-knit group of alumni that includes Michael Bay, Akiva Goldsman,  Joss Whedon, Larry Mark and Rick Nicita. They and others were drawn to  the Middletown, Conn.-based university not just because of the cozy  feeling or its tradition in the liberal arts but largely because of the  reputation of film department founder Jeanine Basinger, who makes each  of her 80 film majors learn to write, direct and edit a movie by hand  (yes, they learn digital, too) as well as study other subjects to enrich  their films. Of course, if they want to know about movies, they can  turn to Wesleyan's archive, which includes the papers of Frank Capra,  Martin Scorsese, Federico Fellini and Clint Eastwood. &quot;If you're  studying <em>On the Waterfront</em>, you can look at Elia Kazan's notebook,&quot; Basinger says. &quot;It's an amazing experience.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $55,736 (includes room and board)</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.A. in film studies</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Miguel Arteta (<em>The Good Girl</em>), Michael Bay (<em>Transformers</em>), Zak Penn (<em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>10. The National Film and Television School</strong></h3>
<p>For decades, the then-National Film School wasn't just the best place  to study filmmaking in the U.K. -- it was pretty much the only one.  That's now changed, but the NFTS has retained the stature that went with  it despite a Beaconsfield location (away from the hub of filmmaking in  London) and, until recently, dirt-poor facilities. Now it boasts a new  building; a bunch of new programs; an innovative leader in indie  producer Nik Powell; teachers like Stephen Frears; and access to  Britain's thriving movie and TV industry through development deals with  Channel 4, the BBC and Aardman. That has provided avenues for such  graduates as cinematographer Roger Deakins and directors Lynne Ramsey,  Nick Broomfield and David Yates.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $14,300 for residents; $32,000 for overseas students</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> M.A. in film and TV</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> David Yates (<em>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2</em>), Nick Park (<em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>), Beeban Kidron (<em>Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;I would not be making films in Hollywood without it. The NFTS was absolutely vital.&quot;  -- <strong>Michael Caton-Jones</strong>, director, <em>Scandal</em>           </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>11. La Femis</strong></h3>
<p>Founded in 1986 by Cultural Minister Jack Lang, La Femis is France's  most prestigious film school. So prestigious, in fact, that only three  percent of students who take the entrance exam are accepted by the  state-run academy whose grads typically go on to win prizes at film  festivals across the globe. </p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $517 for French citizens; $15,334 for foreigners</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> Undergraduate degrees in screenwriting, directing, producing, sound design, editing and film distribution</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Francois Ozon (<em>Swimming Pool</em>), Noemie Lvovsky (<em>Feelings</em>), Celine Sciamma (<em>Tomboy</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>12. University of North Carolina School of the Arts</strong></h3>
<p>Don't come to Carolina unless you're serious about filmmaking.  Academically rigorous, the UNC School of the Arts is a plunge into film  in collaboration with drama, music, dance, design and production studies  and a 65-piece orchestra. By the third year, you're shadowing the likes  of director David Gordon Green. &quot;Our graduates have made films that  receive hundreds of millions of dollars and on the other side of the  spectrum won the Grand Prix at Cannes this year,&quot; says Dean Jordan  Kerner. Coming soon: a new animation and gaming building.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $4,716 for residents; $17,665 for non-residents</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> BFA in animation, art direction,  cinematography, directing, editing and sound, producing and  screenwriting. MFA in film music composition.</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> David Gordon Green (<em>Pineapple Express</em>), Danny McBride (<em>Eastbound &amp; Down</em>), Jody Hill (<em>Observe and Report</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;I feel like UNCSA's film school provided me with an exceptionally  practical filmmaking education. You definitely learned about theory. You  watched lots of films, but more than anything else, you made movies.  You were always pitching your own ideas or getting feedback. You were  always on a set or in an editing suite. Always. So I've found the  industry to be, in many ways, just a bigger version of the world I knew  from school.&quot; -- <strong>Travis Beacham</strong>, screenwriter, <em>Clash of the Titans</em></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>13. University of Texas at Austin</strong></h3>
<p>Ever since Richard Linklater made Austin famous in 1991's <em>Slacker</em>,  slacking is about the last thing anyone in UT's Department of  Radio-Television-Film has done. With South by Southwest and a thriving  indie scene swirling around them, they churn out work in a professional  TV studio, two soundstages and digital picture, audio, editing and  postproduction suites. And then half of the RTF students do two or more  internships. Screenwriters mix with poets and fiction writers in the  nationally ranked Michener Center MFA program.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $4,832 for Texas residents; $15,995 for  non-residents; $4,371 for full-time graduate Texas residents; $8,228 for  graduate non-residents</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.S. in radio-television-film, MFA in film and media production, MFA in screenwriting</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Robert Rodriguez (<em>Machete</em>), Matthew McConaughey (<em>The Lincoln Lawyer</em>), Bruce Hendricks (former president of physical production at Walt Disney Studios)</p>
            <p>&quot;When I acted in <em>Dazed and Confused</em> [during the summer  before his senior year at the University of Texas], it introduced me to  the challenges and triumphs involved in producing an independent film.  Being a part of the Austin film scene at the time helped me get my  start.&quot;-- <strong>Matthew McConaughey</strong></p>

            <h3><strong>14. The Polish National Film, Television and Theater School</strong></h3>
<p>Lodz, as the school is typically called, has produced virtually all  the elder statesmen of Polish cinema -- Andrzej Wajda, Jerzy  Skolimowski, Krzysztof Zanussi and the late Krzysztof Kieslowski came  out of the facility, which was established in 1948. After the fall of  Communism, Lodz expanded and acquired modern film equipment, and the  acting department was revamped to stay in step with new media and the  changing times -- actors were taught simultaneously to work in theater,  film and television. The school has continued to expand by establishing  new departments such as production, editing, script writing,  photography, digital technology and TV journalism.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $8,600-$15,800, depending on the program; students of Polish descent get a 30 percent reduction</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.A., M.A., Ph.D., Professor</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Andrzej Wajda (<em>Ashes and Diamonds</em>), Krzysztof Kieslowski (<em>The Decalogue</em>), Jerzy Skolimowski (<em>Torrents of Spring</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>15. Syracuse University</strong></h3>
<p>Syracuse's Department of Transmedia conveniently includes filmmaking,  computer art (animation and visual effects) and video art all in one  place. Go there and you'll learn the whole process, from script to  preproduction to post. &quot;We're not a factory turning out gaffers,&quot; says  Dean Heath Hanlin. &quot;We're not a boot camp for filmmakers. But we're not a  theory cloud either. We're trying to turn out people who can actually  make something and be smart enough to talk about it.&quot; Syracuse's 40  students a year get plenty of attention -- and some get to experience  &quot;Sorkin Week,&quot; an intense practicum with Hollywood bigwigs led by  Oscar-winning alum Aaron Sorkin.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $53,790 (includes room and board)</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> BFA and MFA in film, with minors and majors also available in animation/VFX</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Albert Maysles (<em>Grey Gardens</em>), Chris Renaud (<em>Despicable Me</em>), Aaron Sorkin (<em>The Social Network</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>16. Stanford University</strong></h3>
<p>Even by Stanford standards, the MFA in documentary film and video  program is exclusive: Eight students a year make movies the old-school  way, on 16mm. &quot;Each student is trained equally in cinematography, sound,  directing and editing, and every quarter, they crew for fellow students  while producing their own films,&quot; says director Jan Krawitz. Coming  circa 2013: a new facility that will be a work of art in itself.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $40,050</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> MFA in documentary film and video</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Mark Becker (<em>Pressure Cooker</em>), Nancy Kates (<em>Brother Outsider</em>), Cynthia Wade (<em>Born Sweet</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>17. Florida State University College of Motion Picture Arts</strong></h3>
<p>Despite being far from any entertainment capital (Tallahassee), FSU  students are going places thanks to an eight-to-one student/faculty  ratio, unusually generous production-cost support of student films and  the Torchlight program, which has put students to work on 40 feature  films shot in Florida. Coming up: an FSU partnership with effects giant  Digital Domain.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $6,600 for in-state undergraduates; $24,120  for out-of-state; $21,735 for in-state graduate production; $38,092 for  out-of-state)</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> BFA in production, animation, digital arts; MFA in production, writing; non-degree through the Torchlight Program</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Alan Ball (<em>American Beauty</em>), Melissa Carter (<em>Little Black Book</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>18. Emerson Visual and Media Arts School</strong></h3>
<p>Originally a Boston school of oratory, Emerson now boasts filmmakers  and writers who are heard loud and clear in Los Angeles, where it's  building a big satellite campus. When student Denis Leary asked a  professor if he could perform his own scripts, the professor said, &quot;It's  Emerson! You can do anything.&quot;</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $32,128 plus fees for undergraduates; $1,004 per credit plus fees for graduates</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> Graduate and undergraduate degrees in visual and performing arts, writing and communications</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Norman Lear (<em>All in the Family</em>), Denis Leary (<em>Rescue Me</em>), Jay Leno</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>19. Loyola Marymount University</strong></h3>
<p>LMU's 10-year-old School of Film and Television, which separates  itself from the pack by stressing humanism over commercialism, is still  all about getting students into the industry: One-third of all students  nab internships, which often lead to real jobs (being based in L.A.  helps). The new Incubator Lab matches students with real-world mentors  for 18 months after graduation -- and funds one winning project. More  socially conscious than most, LMU film professors mentor inner-city  teens each summer, and some win scholarships. In a changing film and TV  industry, new Dean Stephen Ujlaki has a vision for the future.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $37,605 for undergraduates; $985 per unit, plus tuition and fees for graduates  </p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.A. in film, TV, animation and recording arts; MFA in film, TV and screenwriting</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Brian Helgeland (<em>Mystic River</em>), Francis Lawrence (<em>Water for Elephants</em>), Sean McNamara (<em>Soul Surfer</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>20. University of Wisconsin/Milwaukee</strong></h3>
<p>UWM is far from the coastal film capitals, but its small program  trains mainstream talents -- its grads shot nearly 100 episodes of CSI.  It also emphasizes experimental film: Two of <em>Film Comment</em>'s top 30 avant-garde filmmakers of the 21st century were alums.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $18,012</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> BFA in film/video/new genres; MFA in film and video production</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Chris Smith (<em>American Movie</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>21. Rhode Island School of Design</strong></h3>
<p>The 134-year-old RISD's Film, Animation and Video program trains  grads in all three disciplines before they choose one. The art forms  cross-pollinate: grad Gus Van Sant is a painter/photographer/director,  and at RISD he told broke classmate David Byrne, &quot;Maybe the pain of not  getting paid will add to your art.&quot; After RISD, your art tends to pay  off.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $39,482</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> BFA in Film, Animation and Video</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Gus Van Sant (<em>Milk</em>), Seth MacFarlane (<em>Family Guy</em>)</p>
            <p>&quot;What RISD trained me for was something that now [is] the most  marketable thing there is. I mean, what people are looking for now is  individual styles. If you look at all the successful animators these  days -- Matt Groening of The Simpsons, Trey [Parker] and Matt [Stone] at  South Park, Mike Judge at King of the Hill -- they all have very  distinct, original styles, and they feel much more like the RISD  philosophy than the other, more specialized schools.&quot; -- Seth Macfarlane</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>22. Chapman University Dodge College of Film &amp; Media Arts</strong></h3>
<p>&quot;We're not a trade school,&quot; says Dean Bob Bassett. &quot;We're focused on  helping young people find jobs -- and that's the hardest thing.&quot;  Students at the Orange, Calif.-based campus operate like they're at a  miniature studio: The directors direct, the writers write, the producers  produce, and they work with PR and advertising students taught by new  faculty member Dawn Taubin, a former Warners marketing exec.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $19,600 per semester for undergraduates; $15,420-$20,680 for graduates, depending on the discipline</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.A., BFA, M.A. and MFA</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Ben York Jones (<em>Like Crazy</em>), Chris Marrs Piliero (director for the Black Keys' &quot;Tighten Up&quot; music video)</p>
            <p>&quot;Being a comparatively young film school, Dodge is starting to make a  good showing out there in all facets of film and entertainment. It's  been interesting how many people I'll run into and find out they went to  Chapman as well. It puts you on the same team.&quot;  -- <strong>Ben York Jones</strong></p>
            <h3><strong>23. Ringling College of Art and Design</strong></h3>
<p>Ringling's 4-year-old Digital Filmmaking program, where Werner Herzog  teaches, just graduated its first class, and already they've got two  Student Academy Award winners. At the Sarasota, Fla., campus, you direct  commercials your first year, documentaries the second, narratives the  third and a thesis your fourth. U.S. News and World Report called it  America's Most Wired Campus, and digital animation is strong.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $16,140 per semester</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> BFA in a range of disciplines, including computer animation, digital filmmaking, game design and photography</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> The school just graduated its first class last year.</p>
            <p>&quot;Ringling helped me transform from just a kid who liked playing with  cameras into a true, narrative storyteller. It is too early to tell how  much of a career impact it has had, but I'm only three months out of an  undergrad film school and have had meetings with producers at MTV, IFC,  AMC and Screen Gems.&quot; -- Recent graduate  <strong>Jason Letkiewicz</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>24. Northwestern University</strong></h3>
<p>At Northwestern outside Chicago, you can study writing in America's  No. 2 theater and improv town; study film and visual art in a  world-class arts capital; do a directing-for-the-screen &quot;module,&quot; which  involves classes in cinematography, editing and postproduction work or  directing. Then then you make your film.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $41,592</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> B.A./B.S. in radio, television, film history, theory and production of film and media</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Greg Berlanti (producer, <em>Green Lantern</em>), Zach Braff  (<em>Garden State</em>)</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3><strong>25. Colorado Film School</strong></h3>
<p>In partnership with Regis University, the Denver school charges  students as little as $7,000 to make 1,000 BFA movies a year that  visiting teacher Rahmin Bahrani (<em>Chop Shop</em>) compares with Columbia's MFA movies. Effects auteur Douglas Trumbull (<em>2001</em>, <em>The Tree of Life</em>) is working to create a green-screen 3D film studio.</p>
            <p><strong>TUITION</strong> $28,000 for four years for Colorado residents; $58,000 for non-residents</p>
            <p><strong>DEGREES</strong> BFA, AAS, AGS and certificates in writing, directing, producing, acting, postproduction and cinematography</p>
            <p><strong>NOTABLE ALUMNI</strong> Aaron Kroger (<em>Total Recall</em>)</p>
            <p> </p>
            <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In compiling this list, we consulted industry  insiders, execs, filmmakers and film school grads. We asked participants  to rate each program based on the following categories: Alumni / Cost /  Facilities / Industry Access / Strength of Faculty.</p>
