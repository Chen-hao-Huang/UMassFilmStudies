     <h2>PROGRAM  DIRECTOR</h2>
   <h3>Barbara Zecchi</h3>
    <p>Born in the UK and raised in Italy, where she received a Laurea cum laude from the Università Ca&rsquo; Foscari of Venice, Barbara Zecchi holds two Master&rsquo;s Degrees (in Spanish Literatures and Cultures from the University of California San Diego and in Italian Studies from the University of California Los Angeles); a Certificate in Screenwriting from the University Juan Carlos I of Madrid, Spain; and a PhD in Romance Studies from the University of California Los Angeles, with a dissertation entitled <em>The Representation of Rape and the Rape of Representation: Sexual/Textual Violence in Spain and Italy</em>.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Zecchi&rsquo;s research and teaching interests include European and Latin American cinemas, feminist film theory, film adaptation theory, gender studies, and the use of technology in the humanities.</p>
    <p>In addition to a dozen video-graphic essays, presented in the US, UK, Spain, Italy and Mexico, she has authored some 50 articles and book chapters, three monographic books, and seven edited volumes.
