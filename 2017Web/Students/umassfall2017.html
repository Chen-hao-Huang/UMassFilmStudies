            Shimpach Office: ILC N332<br>
            Lecture, lab (screening). Why do we put certain films into categories? What constitutes a film genre, how do
            we recognize it, and what do we do with it? This course examines these questions and more by considering a
            specific genre over the course of the semester. We will learn to think of genre as a way of comparing and
            contrasting different films. Genre will also be thought of as a way of creating expectations and measuring
            experience and meaning. The power of film genre is that it allows us to understand film as a text and film
            as a social practice at the very same time. (Course capacity 25)<br>

            What insights do films with end-of-the-world scenarios, dystopian futures, and post-apocalyptic themes offer
            into the cultural moment that produces them?&nbsp; From alien invasions and planetary collisions to
            cataclysmic war and totalitarian dystopias, from the zombie apocalypse and the rise of machines, to human
            extinction and the end of civilization, what do these films tell us about contemporary realities?&nbsp; How
            do they speak to our anxieties and fears about the future as well as our hopes and aspirations?&nbsp; In
            what ways do these films pose and explore questions of the "human"?&nbsp; End-of-the-world films often
            intersect with other genres (thriller, action film, neo-noir, comedy, art-house, romance, drama,
            experimental, etc.)&nbsp; In this course we will study the cinema of eschatology, of ultimate endings, and
            analyze a range of filmic approaches to the philosophical, psychological, and aesthetic questions raised in

            This course examines the idea of “tragedy,” both as a genre and as a mode of cultural expression. On the one
            hand, much of the time will be focused on considering cinema’s reception (i.e., adaptation, appropriation,
            reworking) of traditional tragedy. This will involve looking at instances of tragic theater – including
            Greek, Roman, early modern, modern – and at their reincarnation on the screen. On the other hand, this
            course explores the more general question of whether or not tragedy, as it is traditionally understood,
            continues to work as an effective or legitimate genre in the modern era, or whether it has in fact been
            replaced by other expressive modes, like melodrama. We will consider as well how cinema has influenced and
            affected our notion of what it means to say something is “tragic.” Weekly screenings and reading of plays.

            light of the challenges posed by immigration (especially non-European immigration), feminism, economic and
            cultural globalization, and France's version of “multiculturalism," casting a wide net over cinema to
            examine the privileged relationship between a nation, an art, and a social practice. </p>

        <h3>THEATER&nbsp; 105 - Drama and the Media - Performing Mythologies in the Contemporary World</h3>
        <p>TuTh 2:30PM - 3:45PM<br>
            Megan Lewis<br>
            South College Room W245<br>
            (Gen. Ed: AT &amp; G)<br>
            As a core course in your General Education, this introductory level class asks you to question common
            assumptions about media, which include theatre/performance, literature, film, advertising, radio, music,
            social media and other forms. Using dramatic conventions, structures, and techniques as tools to enable
            in-depth analysis and critique, we will explore the following questions:</p>
        <p>How are media constructed and produced? Received and understood? And how do media make meaning in culture?
            How are the stories and mythologies that circulate in various media (film, TV, print, social media) made
            "dramatic" or framed by and structured using theatrical techniques? And to what ends? How do social groups
            perform themselves and others?</p>
        <p>Locating our study in the cultures of the United States, Middle East, and Africa, and by exploring the
            connections between "drama" and "media," we will develop our abilities to critically analyze and decode
            meaning embedded in media texts, consider how nations perform themselves and Others using various media, and
            ultimately become more savvy, ethical media consumers/producers and citizens of our global world.</p>
