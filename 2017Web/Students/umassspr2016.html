            This course explores the links between technical operations, creative production design, and actual
            production in the live, multiple-camera HD studio environment. Though loaded with technology, the television
            studio is, from the first instance through the last, a creative environment. Studio technology comprises a
            set of creative tools. Uses these tools are always aimed at actual production of meaningful content. This
            course will explore and put to work the concepts and techniques fundamental to multiple-camera studio
            production in the HD studio environment: conceptualization, visualization, and writing for multiple-camera,
            wide-screen production; production design, including staging, set design, photography and lighting, sound
            design, and graphic design. In the area of studio operations students will learn and put to work skills
            including light placement and mixing, videography using the HD studio camera, sound pickup and mixing, and
            graphics. Students will realize all of this work in collaborative, final studio production projects.<br/>

            Lecture, discussion, lab. Why do we put certain films into categories? What constitutes a film genre, how do
            we recognize it, and what do we do with it? This course examines these questions and more by considering a
            specific genre over the course of the semester. We will learn to think of genre as a way of comparing and
            contrasting different films. Genre will also be thought of as a way of creating expectations and measuring
            experience and meaning. The power of film genre is that it allows us to understand film as a text and film
            as a social practice at the very same time.<br/>

            Agnieszka Holland, Dorota Kedzierzawska and Lech Majewski. Using Freud's theory of dreams, Lacan's notition
            of &quot;the gaze&quot; and Aristotle's theory of tragedy, we will examine the dream-like structure of
            cinematic image to shed light on how history and identity are visually represented by Polish filmmakers. In
            our class discussion throughout the course, we will attempt to identify those qualities that give Polish

            This course is both a writing class for movie-lovers and a film class for writers. Cinema touches nearly
            every corner of popular and intellectual culture, and rich and new varieties of film writing have grown and
            flourished along with it. From the force of the critical essay to the art of the film review, from enquiries
            into the nature of cinema to personal narratives of film experiences, film writing begins on the page and
            moves into the swiftly evolving landscape of new media - film blogs, video essays, podcasts, filmmaker
            interviews, film-review and movie-ranking websites, and social media. We will study films from around the
            world in a variety of genres, from early cinema to today. The core work of the class will involve
            discovering our own insights into films and film art and writing these discoveries across multiple media for
            different audiences.<br/>

            The course explores the social role and meaning of some of the most important actresses of post-WWII Italian
            cinema (Anna Magnani, Sofia Loren, and Monica Vitti, among others) as both metamorphic representatives and
            problematic probes of a rapidly modernizing society, and proposes a model of the female figure as &quot;the
            active face of the crisis&quot; (Giorgio Tinazzi). Conducted in English.<br/>

            conjunction with the John Steinbeck novel, Grapes of Wrath, Capturing the Friedmans with the Susan Orlean
            essay, Seriously Silly, Dead Man Walking with Norman Mailer’s great work of literary nonfiction The
            Executioner’s Song. We will examine the strengths and weaknesses of varying approaches to what amounts to

            Wed 4:00PM-6:45PM &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TBA<br/>
            Cinema today constitutes an important source of popular historical knowledge of the Holocaust. Fiction films
            in particular have come to occupy a central place in our understanding and memorialization of the Jewish
            catastrophe. Given their importance, this course will provide a cultural history of cinematic treatments of
            the Holocaust, trace major trends and changes in Holocaust representations, and raise questions concerning
            historical memory of the Holocaust in national cinemas. The main emphasis will be on narrative cinema, but
            several significant documentaries will also be considered. (GenEd G, HS)<br/>
