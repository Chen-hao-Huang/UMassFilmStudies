            contemporary results of this heritage. Trying to determine if film is the most resolutely modern of the

            2) the factual, realistic and socially critical or anarchistic. Thus, we’ll attempt to discover how modern
            culture deals with avant-garde imperatives to always “make it new.” Films and filmmakers such as Breathless

        <h3>COMP-LIT 391B – DYSTOPIAN FUTURES IN FILM AND FICTION</h3>
        <p>Daphne Patai Cap: 50<br/>
            Tu 4:00 -7:00 PM Herter Hall Rm. 217<br/>

        <p>Literature and film provide us with entertainment, pleasure, and stimulation. But dystopias -- in addition to
            working at that level -- express and address some of our most urgent fears and worries about our future.
            What does it mean to be human in an ever more technological society? How does society organize itself in a
            post-industrial age? What happens to individuals in a world whose culture is ever more homogeneous and
            driven by consumerism? What is the future of the human body? Are humans still linked to the natural world?
            What is the likely fate of our planet? What are the dangers of science and technology to a species whose
            emotions and wisdom may not keep up with its knowledge? What methods of social, economic, and political
            control will postmodern societies depend on? What space will exist for non-conformists? What is the role of
            religion in maintaining social order? These are only a few of the crucial issues to be explored in this
            course.</p>

        <p>This course examines the parallel work of two recognized masters of world cinema, Michelangelo Antonioni
            (1912-2007) and Federico Fellini (1920-1993) between the 1950s and the early 1970s, from their common
            origins and collaborations to their gradually diverging ways of coping with Italy's progressive
            modernization and finally to their complementary ideas of the world and of cinema, which have now become
            global paradigms. Course offered at the 400 and 500 levels, with different course requirements for graduate
            and undergraduate students.</p>

            Tu 4:00PM-7:00PM Bartlett Hall Rm. 201</p>
        <p>They can be heroes; they can be villains. They can be ruthless; they can be sympathetic. They can be right;
            they can be wrong - and perhaps sometimes a bit of both. Since the first film director yelled &quot;Action!&quot;
            on a studio back lot, journalists of all sorts - local reporters, television news crews, even foreign
            correspondents - have been staples of the Hollywood milieu. The movies that have emerged have done much to
            define how people view journalists and continue to inform those opinions - both positive and negative -
            today. In an examination of selected films from the 1930s to current times, this class will explore
            perceptions of reporters, and reporters' choices through the prism of the big screen. Films to be seen will
            range from All The President's Men to The Year of Living Dangerously. Readings likely to include such works
            as Schanberg: The Death and Life of Dith Pran; Caputo: Means of Escape. Open to Journalism, Communicaiton
