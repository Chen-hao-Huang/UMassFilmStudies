            This course examines the situation comedy from sociological and artistic perspectives. We will seek, first
            of all, to understand how situation-comedy is a rich and dynamic meaning-producing genre within the medium
            of television. Secondly we will work to dissect narrative structures, and the genre's uses of mise-en-scene,
            cinematography/ videography, editing, and sound to create specific images of the family through social
            constructions of race, class, and gender. In addition we will use various critical methods such as
            semiotics, genre study, ideological criticism, cultural studies, and so on to interrogate why the sitcom
            form since its inception in the 1950s has remained one of the most popular genres for audiences and industry
            personnel alike and assess what the genre might offer us in terms of a larger commentary on notions of
            difference and identity in the US and beyond. <br/>

            This course explores the links between technical operations, creative production design, and actual
            production in the live, multiple-camera HD studio environment. Though loaded with technology, the television
            studio is, from the first instance through the last, a creative environment. Studio technology comprises a
            set of creative tools. Uses these tools are always aimed at actual production of meaningful content. This
            course will explore and put to work the concepts and techniques fundamental to multiple-camera studio
            production in the HD studio environment: conceptualization, visualization, and writing for multiple-camera,
            wide-screen production; production design, including staging, set design, photography and lighting, sound
            design, and graphic design. In the area of studio operations students will learn and put to work skills
            including light placement and mixing, videography using the HD studio camera, sound pickup and mixing, and
            graphics. Students will realize all of this work in collaborative, final studio production projects.<br/>

            Lecture, discussion, lab. Why do we put certain films into categories? What constitutes a film genre, how do
            we recognize it, and what do we do with it? This course examines these questions and more by considering a
            specific genre over the course of the semester. We will learn to think of genre as a way of comparing and
            contrasting different films. Genre will also be thought of as a way of creating expectations and measuring
            experience and meaning. The power of film genre is that it allows us to understand film as a text and film
            as a social practice at the very same time.<br/>

            Lecture, discussion. Explores modern origin of film experimentation in avant-garde modes such as
            Expressionism, Surrealism and contemporary results of this heritage. Trying to determine if film is the most
            resolutely modern of the media, we’ll look at cinema as the result of two obsessive concerns: 1) the poetic,
            dreamlike and fantastic, 2) the factual, realistic and socially critical or anarchistic. Thus, we’ll attempt
            to discover how modern culture deals with avant-garde imperatives to always “make it new.” Films and
            filmmakers such as <em>Breathless</em> (Godard), <em>My Own Private Idaho</em> (Van Sant), <em>The American
                Soldier</em> (Fassbinder), others. Requirements: one 5-page paper for midterm, ten-page final paper or
            project; attendance. (Gen.Ed. AT)<br/>

            The Victorians crystalized the big problems of modernity that haunt us today. Darwin and Freud, and a
            revolution in gender roles and industry, made for a century of radical change. The 1890s raised liberating
            and terrifying questions about identity: What sort of creatures are we? One response was the creation of
            novels imagining monstrosity such as Dracula's vampires, Wells's dystopia, Wilde's troubled sexuality. How
            about a 2000 year old fabulously beautiful queen of a mummified realm under a volcano (Haggard's She). We'll
            be using some anthropological and psych concepts to unpack the stories and formulate a useful philosophy for
            today. The course includes a required weekly film lab (w/ discussion) that includes adaptations of novels,
            but also documentaries such as "The Search for Satan," about a scandalous delusion in American psychiatry in
            the 1990s (cf Jekyll and Hyde). Requirements: plan on doing a 1 pg problem-solving paper about some of the
            books/films, and three longer essays. Because the film lab is required, you can sign up for 1-3 Independent
            Study credits and explore issues that interest you in some extra writing. An honors colloq. can be added to
            this course, if requested.</p>

            Screening and Workshop. This course is both a writing class for movie-lovers and a film class for writers.
            With cinema touching nearly every corner of popular and intellectual culture, rich and new varieties of film
            writing have grown and flourished along with it. From thinking about what cinema is (and what it can be) to
            personal narratives of film experiences, from the force of the critical essay to the art of the film review,
            and beyond into the swiftly evolving landscape of film in new media—film-review and movie-ranking websites,
            social media, blogs, video essays, podcasts, and other engagements with film. The core work of the class
            concentrates on discovering our own compelling insights into films and film art and writing those
            discoveries for diverse purposes and audiences of all stripes.</p>
