    <p>Daniel Pope 									<br />
MoWe 2:30PM-3:45PM, 								Herter Hall 110 <br />
Screenings: Th 6:00PM - 8:00PM, Herter Hall 108<br />
Cap: 35    </p>
    <p>This course will explore the development of the aesthetic of reality in audiovisual media from film to television and portable screens in the context of modern Italian history. The appeal and the power of the medium to capture and show reality is intricately related with modes of technical production, social and ethical discourse, and any current political order. We will analyze the deployment of 'reality' on screen from the post WWII neorealist redemptive project after Fascism, through the contaminated narrative explorations of artists like Pier Paolo Pasolini and Michelangelo Antonioni, to modern documentary forms and hybrids (docufictions, infotainment) and television's twisted tales of reality in the era of Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset.<br />

    <h3>COMP-LIT 391CS: Cinema &amp; Sound</h3>
    <p>TuTh 10:00-11:15<br />
      Instructor: Andrew Ritchey </p>
    <p>Explores various aspects of film sound from an historical and theoretical perspective. The course is divided into four main sections: historical and theoretical questions; the voice in cinema; music in cinema; and contemporary sound design. The historical scope of the course will include the entire history of cinema sound, from the so-called “silent” era to the present; but we will focus on two particularly salient turning points: the introduction of synchronous sound film in the late 1920s, and the deployment of Digital Surround Sound (DSS) systems in the 1990s. Assigned readings and case studies will provide a strong foundation for audio-visual analysis by equipping students with a critical vocabulary for communicating effectively about sound in cinema. As a means of further developing our critical ears, we will also be audio-viewing and discussing a group of self-reflexive films that take sound technology as their subject. Such films may include <em>Singin’ in the Rain</em> (Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, 1952),<em> The Conversation </em>(Francis Ford Coppola, 1974), <em>Blow Out </em>(Brian De Palma, 1981), <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em> (Peter Strickland, 2012), and <em>Hacked Circuit</em> (Deborah Stratman, 2014). Examining the ways in which these and other self-reflexive films narrate or express certain potentials and anxieties particular to sound recording and representation will help us to better understand the social and cultural meanings associated with mediated sound and listening in various contexts.</p>
    <p>Andrew Ritchey is a teacher, film curator and sound designer currently based in Amherst, MA. His research and teaching interests include film and media theory, sound studies, and European experimental cinemas. His publications have appeared in <em>SubStance</em> and the <em>Quarterly Review of Film and Video</em>, while his creative work has screened at numerous festivals, including the Ann Arbor Film Festival, CPH:DOX, the Internationales Kurzfilm Festival Hamburg, and Los Angeles FilmForum. His most recent curatorial project was “The Secret Society,” a five-day program of historical 16mm American experimental films held in conjunction with the Portland Institute for Contemporary Art’s 2013 Time-Based Art (TBA) festival. Mr. Ritchey is currently completing a PhD in Film Studies at the University of Iowa. He received his MA in Film Studies from Iowa, and a BA with honors in Film Studies from the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

      We 12:20PM - 3:20PM 						Integ. Learning Center S350<br />
      L01: Tu 6:00PM - 8:30PM<br />
      This is a production/theory course for video and film students interested in developing and strengthening the element of performance in their work. How does performance for the camera differ from performance for the stage? How do we find a physical language and a camera language that expand upon one another in a way that liberates the imagination? This course will explore performance and directing in their most diverse possibilities, in a context specific to film and videomakers. The priority of the class will be screening works-in-progress for critique with an emphasis on development of individual approaches to relationships between performance, text, sound and image. We will discuss visual and verbal gesture, dialogue and voice-over, variations of approach with actors and non-actors, narration and voice-over, camera movement and rhythm within the shot, and the structuring of performance in short and long form works. Screenings and readings will introduce students to a wide range of approaches to directing and performance. We will study works by Anna Deavere Smith, Charles Burnett, Akira Kurosawa, Ximena Cuevas and RtMark among others.<br />

      D01 Tu 2:30PM-3:45PM<br />
      D02 Tu 4:00PM-5:15PM<br />
      Lecture, discussion. Explores modern origin of film experimentation in avant-garde modes such as Expressionism, Surrealism and contemporary results of this heritage. Trying to determine if film is the most resolutely modern of the media, we’ll look at cinema as the result of two obsessive concerns: 1) the poetic, dreamlike and fantastic, 2) the factual, realistic and socially critical or anarchistic. Thus, we’ll attempt to discover how modern culture deals with avant-garde imperatives to always “make it new.” Films and filmmakers such as Breathless (Godard), My Own Private Idaho (Van Sant), The American Soldier (Fassbinder), others. Requirements: one 5-page paper for midterm, ten-page final paper or project; attendance. (Gen.Ed. AT)<br />

    <h3>COMP-LIT 391B—DYSTOPIAN FUTURES IN FILM AND FICTION</h3>
    <p>Daphne Patai                                                                                                               Cap: 38<br />
      TuTh 1:00PM-2:15PM 	 TBA	 </p>
    <p>Literature and film provide us with entertainment, pleasure, and stimulation. But dystopias -- in addition to working at that level -- express and address some of our most urgent fears and worries about our future. What does it mean to be human in an ever more technological society? How does society organize itself in a post-industrial age? What happens to individuals in a world whose culture is ever more homogeneous and driven by consumerism? What is the future of the human body? Are humans still linked to the natural world? What is the likely fate of our planet? What are the dangers of science and technology to a species whose emotions and wisdom may not keep up with its knowledge? What methods of social, economic, and political control will postmodern societies depend on? What space will exist for non-conformists? What is the role of religion in maintaining social order? These are only a few of the crucial issues to be explored in this course.<br />

    <h3>COMP-LIT 391CS: Cinema &amp; Sound</h3>
    <p>TuTh 10:00-11:15<br />
      Instructor: Andrew Ritchey </p>
    <p>Explores various aspects of film sound from an historical and theoretical perspective. The course is divided into four main sections: historical and theoretical questions; the voice in cinema; music in cinema; and contemporary sound design. The historical scope of the course will include the entire history of cinema sound, from the so-called “silent” era to the present; but we will focus on two particularly salient turning points: the introduction of synchronous sound film in the late 1920s, and the deployment of Digital Surround Sound (DSS) systems in the 1990s. Assigned readings and case studies will provide a strong foundation for audio-visual analysis by equipping students with a critical vocabulary for communicating effectively about sound in cinema. As a means of further developing our critical ears, we will also be audio-viewing and discussing a group of self-reflexive films that take sound technology as their subject. Such films may include <em>Singin’ in the Rain</em> (Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, 1952),<em> The Conversation </em>(Francis Ford Coppola, 1974), <em>Blow Out </em>(Brian De Palma, 1981), <em>Berberian Sound Studio</em> (Peter Strickland, 2012), and <em>Hacked Circuit</em> (Deborah Stratman, 2014). Examining the ways in which these and other self-reflexive films narrate or express certain potentials and anxieties particular to sound recording and representation will help us to better understand the social and cultural meanings associated with mediated sound and listening in various contexts. </p>

    <h3>ITALIAN  397J: From Neorealism to Reality TV—The Camera Eye/The I on Camera</h3>
    <p>Daniel Pope 									Cap: 35<br />
      MoWe 2:30PM-3:45PM, 								Herter Hall 110 <br />
      Screenings: Th 6:00PM - 8:00PM, Herter Hall 108<br />
      This course will explore the development of the aesthetic of reality in audiovisual media from film to television and portable screens in the context of modern Italian history. The appeal and the power of the medium to capture and show reality is intricately related with modes of technical production, social and ethical discourse, and any current political order. We will analyze the deployment of 'reality' on screen from the post WWII neorealist redemptive project after Fascism, through the contaminated narrative explorations of artists like Pier Paolo Pasolini and Michelangelo Antonioni, to modern documentary forms and hybrids (docufictions, infotainment) and television's twisted tales of reality in the era of Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset.<br />

    <p>John Katzenbach 							Cap: 25<br />
      Tu 4:00PM - 7:00PM							TBA<br />
      They can be heroes; they can be villains. They can be ruthless; they can be sympathetic. They can be right; they can be wrong - and perhaps sometimes a bit of both. Since the first film director yelled &quot;Action!&quot; on a studio back lot, journalists of all sorts - local reporters, television news crews, even foreign correspondents - have been staples of the Hollywood milieu. The movies that have emerged have done much to define how people view journalists and continue to inform those opinions - both positive and negative - today. In an examination of selected films from the 1930s to current times, this class will explore perceptions of reporters, and reporters' choices through the prism of the big screen. Films to be seen will range from All The President's Men to The Year of Living Dangerously. Readings likely to include such works as Schanberg: The Death and Life of Dith Pran; Caputo: Means of Escape. <br />
