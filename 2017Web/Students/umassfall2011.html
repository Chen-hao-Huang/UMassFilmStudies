            What is an Afrocentric vision of woman and what does a woman&rsquo;s vision of Africa say about being
            African and Black around the world? These are some of the questions explored in this course on women,
            identity, and Afrocentric film practices. An objective of the course is to introduce students to the
            evolution of African women in all aspects of the cinema as image and as image makers. This course not only
            explores depictions of women, but especially women of color who direct, produce, and write films within the
            African Diasporic world. Specifically we look at discourses about women and works by filmmakers on and off
            the continent of Africa that take both an historical and global approach, in terms of issues of
            representation and film practice. We will study the different and parallel ways these filmmakers write their
            own sense of identity into their works about who they are as filmmakers speaking for and about issues that
            may be important to women of African descent. We will look at the various political, social and cultural
            roles of African women in the visual media of film, video, and television and engage in critical
            perspectives that examine how Black and African women explore subjectivity, the body, and positionality
            within the Diaspora. Some of the films we will study include films from Nigeria, Algeria, France, Great
            Britain, and the U.S. such as Tsitsi Dangarembga&rsquo;s Everyone's Child; These Hands by Flora
            Mbugu-Schelling; Ngozi Onwurah&rsquo;s Monday's Girls; Euzhan Palcy's Rue Cases Negres (Sugar Cane Alley);
            Daughter&rsquo;s of the Dust by Julie Dash; Compensation by Zeinabu Irene Davis. This course includes an
            evening lab and some of the films will be screened during the Massachusetts Multicultural Film Festival as a
            part of the Interdepartmental Program in Film Studies at the University of Massachusetts.<br/>

        <p>Fall 2011 Topic: &quot;Directing and Performance for Media.&quot; This is an advanced production/theory
            course for video students interested in developing and strengthening the elements of directing and
            performance in their work. This course will explore directing and performance in their most diverse
            possibilities, in a context specific to film and videomakers. Students will gain skills in production and
            criticism through video production assignments and analysis of theoretical discourses that ground issues of
            production. The course will include the study of cinematography, sound recording, processing and mixing, the
            study and practice of editing theory, aesthetics and techniques including an exploration of structure and
            formats in experimental, narrative and hybrid forms. How does performance for the camera differ from
            performance for the stage? How do we find a physical language and a camera language that expand upon one
            another in a way that liberates the imagination? We will discuss visual and verbal gesture, dialogue and
            voice-over, variations of approach with actors and non-actors, narration and voice-over, camera movement and
            rhythm within the shot, and the structuring of performance in short and long form works. Screenings and
            readings will introduce students to a wide range of approaches to directing and performance. We will study
            works by Pedro Costa, Wong Kar Wai, Charles Burnett, Nagisa Oshima, Abdellatif Kechiche, Ximena Cuevas and
            Apichatpong Weerasethakul. <br/>

            context of a brief look at the cinematic achievements of such filmmakers as Bergman, Bresson, Kurosawa,
            Mizoguchi, Pasolini, Fellini and others and their philosophy of film as a spiritual art, we will focus on
            the art and times of the Russian film director, Andrey Tarkovsky. Of interest to students in Comparative
            Literature, Film, English, Art, Philosophy, History, Religion, and Russian Studies. No prerequisites, other
            than an open mind and a genuine interest in filmmaking that is unlike any other. No prior familiarity with
            the work of these directors is assumed. OIT computer account is required. A significant portion of the
            course will use resources on the Web; students will be expected to do some of the coursework electronically.
            Comparative Literature and Russian majors and graduate students will be expected to do some research in a
            foreign language.<br/>

            The course traces a cultural and cinematographic history of Italian modernity through the works of its major
            film directors emphasizing how, while addressing the nation, they were also contributing to the shaping of
            modern film aesthetics. Pointing to the relevance of cinema which speaks to social and existential issues,
            we will become critically aware of film as cultural and aesthetic construct, and will analyze how the
            moving-sound-images are constructed within the screen/frame and in the socio-political context that
            surrounds them. <br/>

            They can be heroes; they can be villains. They can be ruthless; they can be sympathetic. They can be right;
            they can be wrong - and perhaps sometimes a bit of both. Since the first film director yelled &quot;Action!&quot;
            on a studio back lot, journalists of all sorts - local reporters, television news crews, even foreign
            correspondents - have been staples of the Hollywood milieu. The movies that have emerged have done much to
            define how people view journalists and continue to inform those opinions - both positive and negative -
            today. In an examination of selected films from the 1930s to current times, this class will explore
            perceptions of reporters, and reporters' choices through the prism of the big screen. Films to be seen will
            range from All The President's Men to The Year of Living Dangerously. Readings likely to include such works
            as Schanberg: The Death and Life of Dith Pran; Caputo: Means of Escape.<br/>

            This course offers an in depth exploration of the artistic and journalistic impulse to capture in words and
            images what the Irish call the &ldquo;music of what happens.&rdquo; Sample pairings include Harvest of Shame
            shown in conjunction with the John Steinbeck novel, Grapes of Wrath, Capturing the Friedmans with the Susan
            Orlean essay, Seriously Silly, Dead Man Walking with Norman Mailer&rsquo;s great work of literary nonfiction
            The Executioner&rsquo;s Song. We will examine the strengths and weaknesses of varying approaches to what
            amounts to the same material, with a special emphasis on how the author/director honors truth and fact
            simultaneously. <br/>

            Motives used to explore the development of American politics in the 20th century. The forces that shaped our
            politics early in the century (immigration, reform, religion), the rise of &quot;big&quot; government in the
            depression and World War II years (the new roles of the federal government, the enhanced presidency,
            internationalism, and anti-communism), and selected issues (race, gender, modern campaigns) prominent since
            the 1960s. The meaning of political democracy in America and how our understanding of it has adapted to
            changing times and conditions. (Gen.Ed. HS)<br/>

        <h4>SPAN 597SW SCREENWRITING WORKSHOP: HOW TO CREATE ORIGINAL FEMALE CHARACTERS</h4>
        <p>Inés París<br/>
            (1 credit) <br/>
            Nov. 1 - Nov. 4 <br/>
            4:00PM - 7:00PM at UMass (Continuing Ed) and Smith College <br/>
            This exciting five days intensive screenwriting workshop is taught by visiting scholar Inés París, an Award
            Winning film director and screenwriter from Spain, with a broad teaching experience at international
            institutions. Through her comedies — <em>A mi madre les gustan las mujeres</em> (<em>My mother likes
                women</em>); <em>Semen, una historia de amor (Semen, a love story</em>); and <em>Miguel and
                Williams</em>, among others — Inés París promotes social criticism and attacks stereotypical gender
            roles in contemporary society. Founder and President of CIMA (Association of Women in the Audiovisual), Inés
            París has been a fundamental figure in Spain to raise awareness about the situation of women in the Film
            Industry.&nbsp; By bringing her practical experience to the classroom, Inés París’s goal in this workshop is
            twofold. On one end we will analyze patriarchal gender stereotypes in cinema and in tv series and, on the
            other, we will work to create stories with original female characters that deconstruct and overcome
            patriarchal gender constraints.</p>
        <p>Class is taught in Spanish with English translation. Students with no knowledge of Spanish are welcome.
            Spanish Majors and Minors will do their written assignments in Spanish. [<a
