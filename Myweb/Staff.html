His research interests cover cinema studies, television studies, media and audience studies, and cultural studies, focusing on the social and institutional construction of the media audience, the cultural history of film and media, and the value and meanings created at the conjuncture of cultural, institutional, and textual practice.  His book <em>Television in Transition: The Life and Afterlife of the Narrative Action Hero</em> (Wiley-Blackwell 2010) combines and connects analysis of recent television industry practices with close readings of four individual, popular programs to explain the shifting media terrain within which innovation takes place and meaning is produced.  His work has also appeared in such journals as <em>Cultural Studies</em>, <em>Social Semiotics</em>, and <em>American Quarterly</em> as well as such collections as <em>Media and Public Spheres</em>, <em>The Handbook of Media Audiences</em>, <em>The International Encyclopedia of Media Studies</em>, and <em>Race, Empire, and the Crisis of the Subprime</em>, and the forthcoming <em>Routledge Companion to Global Popular Culture</em>.  He is currently writing his next book, tentatively titled<em> Pleasant Pastimes for Unoccupied People: Inventing the Motion Picture Audience</em>, that will trace the origins of the commodity media audience’s links to meaning and governance.

Her personal geography parallels her academic path tracking Russian-Jewish culture at home and abroad. For years she followed Russian immigrant cultural production in Israel: she published <em>Gesher: Russian Theater in Israel</em> (2005) about a unique bilingual theater in Tel Aviv, and a series of articles about Russian-Israeli cinema. Then she detoured into studying gender and power relations, and published a collection <em>Ladies and Gents: Public Toilets and Gender</em> (2009). Back on her Russian-Jewish track, she has recently finished writing a book about the unknown, forgotten, or banned Holocaust films in the Soviet Union (soon to be published by Rutgers UP). Olga Gershenson teaches courses on Jewish cultural studies, such as &quot;Jewish Theater and Film&quot; or &quot;Israeli and Palestinian Popular Cultures.&quot; [<a href="http://people.umass.edu/olga" target="_blank">Olga Gershenson's website</a>]</p>
