    <h2>ABOUT THE PROGRAM</h2>
    <p>The Certificate Program in Film Studies offers undergraduates a comprehensive course of study in the history, criticism, theory, aesthetics, and production of the moving image in the unique context of an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary program featuring Film Studies faculty and courses from departments and colleges across the University, including Afro-American Studies, Anthropology, Art and Art History, Asian Languages and Literatures, Communication, Comparative Literature, French &amp; Italian, Germanic Languages and Literatures, Music, Political Science, Spanish &amp; Portuguese, Theater, the Commonwealth College, and the School of Management.  </p>
    <p>The Interdepartmental Program in Film Studies is the home of the <a href="about-mmff.html">Massachusetts Multicultural Film Festival</a>, an annual series that brings to the campus and Five College community important new international films and visiting filmmakers.  Certificate students are encouraged to participate in the Festival’s one-credit colloquium and internship program as well as in the annual Five College Student Film and Video Festival which showcases the best work of undergraduates in the Five Colleges and offers valuable opportunities to Certificate students interested in production to screen their film and video projects and to participate in producing and organizing the Festival. </p>
           <p> The <a href="about-roif.html">Michael S. Roif Award In Film Studies</a> is a competitive annual cash prize awarded to a single student or divided between two students enrolled in the University’s Undergraduate Film Studies Certificate Program whose film, video, or moving image media work demonstrates exceptional creativity and accomplishment.   The award is based upon an endowment, made by his family, in honor of Michael S. Roif, a University alumnus and film enthusiast.  Previous winners have gone on to achieve further successes in filmmaking.</p>
      <h2>ADMISSION POLICY</h2>
<p>Any student formally enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst may pursue a Certificate in Film Studies <em>in conjunction with his or her departmental major</em>. Upon graduation, students who have completed all certificate requirements will receive a Certificate in Film Studies that is noted on the transcript, in addition to their UMASS diploma.  Students from the other Five Colleges and graduate students are not eligible to earn a Certificate but may enroll in courses.  </p>
<h3>TO ENROLL</h3>
<p>University undergraduates make an initial enrollment appointment with an advisor in the Film Studies office and are expected to update their files in the office every semester thereafter.  </p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in the program in their freshman or sophomore year.  A short advising appointment is recommended each semester to ensure a coherent plan of study. Bring an <em>Unofficial Transcript</em> printed from SPIRE to each advising appointment.</p>
<h2> REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<p>  A student who wishes to obtain the Certificate in Film Studies must fulfill the following requirements: complete a minimum of <strong>6 approved courses (either 3 or 4 credits per course) </strong>in film and/or video and television <strong>from at least three different departments/programs</strong>. These 18 credits are drawn from five categories of courses, including an introductory course in film language; one course in theory or history of film; one in genre or national cinema; one upper‑level seminar (400 or higher); and one elective, preferably a production course.  Certificate students must maintain a<strong> </strong>Grade Point Average of 2.5 or higher within the Certificate Program; no courses with a grade lower than C will count toward the Certificate; no pass/fail courses may be counted towards the minimum requirements.   In order to be awarded the Certificate, students must fulfill all criteria and submit a transcript to the Film Studies office for verification of grades in their <em>final</em> semester before graduation.</p>
<h3>CORE COURSES</h3>
<p><strong>Minimum number of credits for the Film Studies Certificate             TOTAL:  18 credits in 6 courses</strong><br>
  The following list by category constitutes the core from which these courses will be selected.  Please note that in any semester, additional courses are offered in all, or nearly all, categories, but only a few courses are offered every semester.  Please see the Undergraduate Advisor if you have any questions.</p>

    <p>Barry Spence is working on his Ph.D. in Comparative Literature and is pursuing the graduate certificate in Film Studies. His primary areas of concentration are ancient Greek and Latin tragedy and epic, James Joyce, the aesthetics of literary and cinematic modernism and postmodernism, art-house cinema, and the material culture of the book. His research interests include semantics, narratology, paratextuality, theories of metaphor and figurative language, and cognitive approaches to literature and film. Recently, he has given papers on conceptual metaphor in Sophocles, on Pier Paolo Pasolini’s film and semiotic theory, and on modes of polysemy in James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>.</p>
